# Quick Start Guide

## For Immediate Use

### Step 1: First Time Setup
```bash
env.bat
```
**Run this ONCE to set up your Python environment.**

### Step 2: Run the Bot
```bash
test.bat
```
**Run this every time you want to use the bot.**

---

## Detailed Instructions

### Option 1: Run with GUI (Recommended)
```bash
test.bat
```
- Opens a graphical interface
- Login with your credentials
- Click buttons to perform actions
- Credentials are saved automatically

### Option 2: Run from Command Line (Manual)
```bash
env\Scripts\activate
python main.py your_username your_password
```
- Runs all actions automatically
- Login → Feed → Learn → Guess
- Good for automation/scheduling

## What Changed?

### ✓ FIXED: Smart Feeding
**Before:** Always fed 10 times (wasteful)  
**Now:** Checks if pet needs food, stops when full

### ✓ Better Organization
**Before:** All code in 2 large files  
**Now:** Organized into logical modules

### ✓ Easier to Maintain
**Before:** Hard to find specific features  
**Now:** Each module has clear purpose

## File Quick Reference

| File | Purpose | When to Edit |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `main.py` | Start the app | Rarely |
| `src/config.py` | Settings & URLs | Change URLs or settings |
| `src/utils.py` | Helper functions | Add utilities |
| `src/bot_core.py` | Bot actions | Add new game actions |
| `src/gui.py` | GUI interface | Change interface |

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
env\Scripts\activate
python test_structure.py
```

Or just run `test.bat` to launch the app!

Should output:
```
==================================================
TEVECLUB BOT - NEW STRUCTURE TEST
==================================================
Testing imports...
✓ Config loaded
✓ Utils loaded
✓ Bot core loaded

ALL TESTS PASSED! ✓
```

## Common Tasks

### Change URLs
Edit `src/config.py`:
```python
LOGIN_URL = "https://new-url.com/"
```

### Add Custom User Agents
Create `user_agents.json`:
```json
[
  "Mozilla/5.0 ...",
  "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
]
```

### Modify Feed Attempts
Edit `src/config.py`:
```python
MAX_FEED_ATTEMPTS = 5  # Change from 10 to 5
```

### Build Executable
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico --add-data "icon.ico;." main.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'
```
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the project directory:
```bash
cd d:\Github\teveclub
python main.py
```

### Dependencies Missing
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```
**Solution:** Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Icon Not Found
**Solution:** Make sure `icon.ico` is in the same directory as `main.py`

## Next Steps

You mentioned wanting to make more changes later. Here are some ideas:

1. **Add Logging**
   - Replace print statements with proper logging
   - Save logs to file for debugging

2. **Schedule Automation**
   - Run bot at specific times
   - Use Windows Task Scheduler or cron

3. **Multiple Accounts**
   - Support managing multiple accounts
   - Switch between accounts in GUI

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - More specific error messages
   - Retry logic for failed requests

5. **Statistics**
   - Track feeding history
   - Show stats in GUI

6. **Configuration File**
   - Add settings.ini or config.yml
   - User-customizable settings

## Need Help?

The code is now well-organized and documented:
- Each function has docstrings explaining what it does
- Modules are separated by responsibility
- Configuration is centralized

Start with `main.py` and follow the imports to understand the flow!

## Summary of Improvements

✓ Fixed food system (smart feeding)  
✓ Modular structure (easy to maintain)  
✓ Better naming (Python conventions)  
✓ Centralized config (easy to change)  
✓ Reusable utilities (DRY principle)  
✓ Documentation (README, guides, docstrings)  
✓ Both GUI and CLI modes  
✓ Test script included  

**Your bot is now more efficient and easier to work with!**
